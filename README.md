This is my attempt at a substack basic clone.

Django backend, front end is purely HTML, CSS/Bootstrap, and HTMX with a touch of jQuery.

Areas to improve for future projects:
1) The CSS is messy. I mix bootstrap, with a styles.css sheet, as well as in-html styling. This is an unacceptable practice in the real world as it is not structured in a logical manner if anyone else needed to go back and review/work on it
2) Lack of unittesting. In future projects, my plan is to follow TDD-structured development style as it is practical and will protect about bugs as the codebase develops.
